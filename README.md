# covid19DataAnalysis
This project involves how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. In this project, I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, I have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. Later I used the deaths report of covid 19 dataset to check the co-relation between the merged data set and deaths across the country

# Step by step process:
1 Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
2 Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.
3 Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.
4 Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn.
5 Comparing the co-relation
